===============  INFO ==============
- app folder is the hero of the project
- desktop => make text , mobile make icon
- opacity chnage the background and text , you can sepcify only to change one of theme
- seperate logic from ui  like =>  loginModal(ui) , useLoginModal (logic)
- if you add sync before any function it will be a promise
- hooks = logic 
- Either use 'npm i package --save-dev'  or 'npm i  -D  package'



========= Mindset ===========
- Catching rendering errors with an error boundary 
- You are designing the UI and you have the logic side you 
- In Auth UI you shoul depend on toggling modals not redirect urls
-
